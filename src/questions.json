During the entire world war, 13 million forced laborers were deployed. This was mainly used to maintain agricultural supplies and armaments production. Almost every second worker in agriculture and every third worker in mining was a foreign civilian forced laborer or prisoner of war. However, countless individuals and municipal administrations also benefited. The proportion of forced laborers was particularly high in Nazi companies such as the Hermann-Goering-Werke or state-owned enterprises such as the Reichsbahn.",

    "options": ["Yes, all forced laborers had the same precarious legal status", "No, working conditions depended heavily on the nationality of the worker"],
