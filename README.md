This project contains the code for a quiz webpage about Forced Labor in Germany during
the National Socialist era.

## About the Quiz
As part of the seminar 'Computational Social Science' and in cooperation with the NS Documentation Center in Munich, we 
have created a quiz website, which is intended to serve as an educational medium and part of the culture of remembrance 
for the future museum site in Neuaubing. The quiz deals with the topic of forced labor during the National Socialist era
and in the course of the Second World War in Germany, focusing in particular on the former forced labor camp in Neuaubing.

The quiz aims to educate interactively on the topic of forced labor and to remember the crimes and living conditions of 
that time. We chose the quiz format not to test participants' prior knowledge, but to create a learning experience that 
deviates from the usual provision of information in museums. The advantage of a quiz is that participants can assess 
their own judgments and biases before being confronted with the "correct" answer. We hope this will result in a more 
sensitive and memorable learning experience. Before each question, the quiz provides context within the historical 
context and offers in-depth information for each answer. We have packaged the facts and information into simple and 
quickly accessible statistics and also used historical photographic material.The idea is for the quiz to support the 
exhibition in Neuaubing and be accessible both during a museum visit and for people who cannot visit the museum in 
person, or to generate interest in visiting the museum. This is possible because the quiz can be hosted on the web and 
does not need to be installed as an app. Participants can take the quiz on a touchscreen in the museum, on their 
smartphone, or on their own computer at home. The implementation is designed so that additional questions or content 
changes can be easily made, allowing for flexible use by museum organizers.
